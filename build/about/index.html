            <article class="main-content">
          <p>During the World War II years more than six million women entered the workforce. Many were hired for positions
            that had up until that time been defined as “men’s jobs” in basic industries: automobiles, shipbuilding, aircraft
            manufacturing, electrical equipment manufacture, and transportation. At the peak of wartime employment, women
            constituted between one-third and one-half the workers in many basic industries. Some historians have called this
            change transformative as it swept aside opposition to hiring women workers and cleared the way for a massive
            expansion of the female workforce in the second half of the twentieth-century. However, a closer look at the
            evidence indicates that World War II never fully legitimized the entry of women into the labor market. Women were
            seen as being in the workforce on a temporary basis, for the duration of the national emergency. The types of
            social supports and day care facilities that would have had to be established for women to fully participate in the
            labor market were never put into place. Employers and many labor unions assumed that when the men came home from
            the service they would reclaim their jobs and women would return to the domestic sphere. These expectations were
            reinforced by the memory of the Great Depression with many policy makers, union officials, and business men
            thinking that unemployment would once again become a problem and that male heads of households needed to be assured
            that they could return to their jobs. Whatever the cause, at the end of the war the vast majority of the Rosies
            left or were forced out of their wartime production jobs. Many found other work, mostly in traditional female jobs.
            Others married and raised families in an era when the <i>Feminine Mystique</i> defined domestic relations in the
            United States.</p>
          <p>Spargel Productions and New York University’s Tamiment Library are collaborating on a project to document the
            stories of Rosie the Riveter. These oral histories were created on digital video and portions of them will be used
            in the forthcoming Spargel Production new media project “The Girl With The Rivet Gun.” They are being preserved at
            the Tamiment Library. Most are full life histories describing early family history, education, employment
            experiences before the war, wartime work, and life after World War II. As one would expect, a complex picture that
            emerges from these interviews. Looking back the narrators found their wartime work experience transformative. It
            changed the ways in which they viewed themselves, instilling confidence, leading them to question the idea of
            separate spheres and providing a sense of pride and accomplishment that remained with them throughout their lives.
            This may be one of the reasons that most of these Rosies continued to work outside the home. Many went on to
            college and graduate school, and had very interesting careers. Beyond that the experiences varied. African American
            women faced particular challenges with racial discrimination. Class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation also defined
            the wartime and postwar experiences of many of the Rosies.</p>
          <p>The intellectual scaffolding for the interviews presented on this site is based on a growing body of historical
            literature about Rosie the Riveter. Discussions between narrators and interviewers focused a wide range of topics
            including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transitions from farm to factory, rural to urban America</li>
            <li>Relations with supervisors</li>
            <li>Gender relations and discrimination at work</li>
            <li>The development of new patterns of occupational segregation</li>
            <li>Sex typing of jobs during the war</li>
            <li>Images of femininity in the war plants</li>
            <li>Equal pay</li>
            <li>Ambiguities in job classification as gender definitions become malleable</li>
            <li>Trade union experiences</li>
            <li>Women’s role in the union movement</li>
            <li>Ideas about seniority and aspirations for permanent jobs</li>
            <li>How experiences vary between industries and job sites</li>
            <li>Family roles</li>
            <li>The continuing ideal of domesticity</li>
            <li>Issues of child care and housework--the “double day”</li>
            <li>Race relations</li>
            <li>Sexual orientation and work experience</li>
            <li>Getting, spending, and consumerism</li>
            <li>Conflict and accommodation as pre-war sex segregation returns</li>
            <li>Response to losing their jobs at war’s end</li>
            <li>Post-war employment experiences- most of these Rosies continued to work after the war.</li>

            with the legendary Kartemquin Films (Hoop Dreams, The New Americans, The Interrupters). They have produced and
            directed documentary projects for New York University, The Juilliard School, The Park Avenue Armory, and Lincoln
            Center’s Beyond The Machine concert. Anne and Kirsten bring the unique storytelling sensibility of a theatre
            background to their film work. They share a deep commitment to projects that celebrate the transformative power of
            the human spirit, where the individual experience illuminates the face of society as a whole. For more information

            International Film Festival, will be shown at the Traverse City Film Festival and has been named one of the 5 most
            essential documentaries of 2013. It will have a major theatrical release in the coming months. Hemmerdinger is
            Executive Producer of LOST AND SOUND, an award-winning British documentary that follows 3 artists over 2 years, as
            they journey deep into silence and sound to re-discover music after deafness. In October 2013, Elizabeth
            Hemmerdinger and Anne de Mare, who also collaborated on BEYOND THESE WALLS, a film about the experiences of
            Baroness Mariuccia Zerilli-Marimò during World War II, screened their film and participated in a symposium entitled
            Women and War in a prestigious “La Pietra Dialogue,” at Villa La Pietra, New York University’s campus in Florence,
            Italy. Hemmerdinger, currently Visiting Artist at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, has written for Ms. Magazine; is a member
