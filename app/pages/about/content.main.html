  <p>During the World War II years more than six million women entered the workforce. Many were hired for positions
    that had up until that time been defined as “men’s jobs” in basic industries: automobiles, shipbuilding, aircraft
    manufacturing, electrical equipment manufacture, and transportation. At the peak of wartime employment, women
    constituted between one-third and one-half the workers in many basic industries. Some historians have called this
    change transformative as it swept aside opposition to hiring women workers and cleared the way for a massive
    expansion of the female workforce in the second half of the twentieth-century. However, a closer look at the
    evidence indicates that World War II never fully legitimized the entry of women into the labor market. Women were
    seen as being in the workforce on a temporary basis, for the duration of the national emergency. The types of
    social supports and day care facilities that would have had to be established for women to fully participate in the
    labor market were never put into place. Employers and many labor unions assumed that when the men came home from
    the service they would reclaim their jobs and women would return to the domestic sphere. These expectations were
    reinforced by the memory of the Great Depression with many policy makers, union officials, and business men
    thinking that unemployment would once again become a problem and that male heads of households needed to be assured
    that they could return to their jobs. Whatever the cause, at the end of the war the vast majority of the Rosies
    left or were forced out of their wartime production jobs. Many found other work, mostly in traditional female jobs.
    Others married and raised families in an era when the <i>Feminine Mystique</i> defined domestic relations in the
    United States.</p>
  <p>Spargel Productions and New York University’s Tamiment Library are collaborating on a project to document the
    stories of Rosie the Riveter. These oral histories were created on digital video and portions of them will be used
    in the forthcoming Spargel Production new media project “The Girl With The Rivet Gun.” They are being preserved at
    the Tamiment Library. Most are full life histories describing early family history, education, employment
    experiences before the war, wartime work, and life after World War II. As one would expect, a complex picture that
    emerges from these interviews. Looking back the narrators found their wartime work experience transformative. It
    changed the ways in which they viewed themselves, instilling confidence, leading them to question the idea of
    separate spheres and providing a sense of pride and accomplishment that remained with them throughout their lives.
    This may be one of the reasons that most of these Rosies continued to work outside the home. Many went on to
    college and graduate school, and had very interesting careers. Beyond that the experiences varied. African American
    women faced particular challenges with racial discrimination. Class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation also defined
    the wartime and postwar experiences of many of the Rosies.</p>
  <p>The intellectual scaffolding for the interviews presented on this site is based on a growing body of historical
    literature about Rosie the Riveter. Discussions between narrators and interviewers focused a wide range of topics
    including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transitions from farm to factory, rural to urban America</li>
    <li>Relations with supervisors</li>
    <li>Gender relations and discrimination at work</li>
    <li>The development of new patterns of occupational segregation</li>
    <li>Sex typing of jobs during the war</li>
    <li>Images of femininity in the war plants</li>
    <li>Equal pay</li>
    <li>Ambiguities in job classification as gender definitions become malleable</li>
    <li>Trade union experiences</li>
    <li>Women’s role in the union movement</li>
    <li>Ideas about seniority and aspirations for permanent jobs</li>
    <li>How experiences vary between industries and job sites</li>
    <li>Family roles</li>
    <li>The continuing ideal of domesticity</li>
    <li>Issues of child care and housework--the “double day”</li>
    <li>Race relations</li>
    <li>Sexual orientation and work experience</li>
    <li>Getting, spending, and consumerism</li>
    <li>Conflict and accommodation as pre-war sex segregation returns</li>
    <li>Response to losing their jobs at war’s end</li>
    <li>Post-war employment experiences- most of these Rosies continued to work after the war.</li>

    GIRL WITH THE RIVET GUN, based on these stories. In collaboration with award-winning documentary filmmakers Anne de
    Mare and Kirsten Kelly, this project is in the early stages of development, supported by funding from the Hite
    Foundation and the Philip and Cheryl Milstein Foundation. GOOD SISTER, a short film written and produced by
    Hemmerdinger, is an official selection of the Boston International Film Festival (April 2013) and New York New
    Filmmakers (December 2013). ELAINE: SHOOT ME, produced and directed by Chiemi Karasawa and produced by Elizabeth
    Hemmerdinger, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April. This film has already been shown at the Berkshire
    International Film Festival, will be shown at the Traverse City Film Festival and has been named one of the 5 most
    essential documentaries of 2013. It will have a major theatrical release in the coming months. Hemmerdinger is
    Executive Producer of LOST AND SOUND, an award-winning British documentary that follows 3 artists over 2 years, as
    they journey deep into silence and sound to re-discover music after deafness. In October 2013, Elizabeth
    Hemmerdinger and Anne de Mare, who also collaborated on BEYOND THESE WALLS, a film about the experiences of
    Baroness Mariuccia Zerilli-Marimò during World War II, screened their film and participated in a symposium entitled
    Women and War in a prestigious “La Pietra Dialogue,” at Villa La Pietra, New York University’s campus in Florence,
    Italy. Hemmerdinger, currently Visiting Artist at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, has written for Ms. Magazine; is a member
    of the Board of Directors of <a href="www.womensvoicesforchange.org">Women's Voices for Change</a>, and a regular
    contributor to its website. She was a founding board member of Dancing Dreams, which teaches a unique collaboration
